rem
rem A clean Windows 11 has no Python but still answers to the name: the
rem Store leaves an execution alias on PATH, so `where python` finds a
rem real file and succeeds, and that file then exits 9009 the moment you
rem run it. A locate-only check is therefore worse than no check at all,
rem because it passes and the launch fails anyway. Only executing an
rem interpreter proves one is there.
rem
rem `if errorlevel` is used rather than %errorlevel%, which expands when a
rem block is PARSED and would test a stale value from an earlier command.
